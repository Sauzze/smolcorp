# Smolcorp's hook, run by every coding agent it follows. Forwards each
# hook event to the app.
#
#   report.sh [agent]   claude (the default), codex, gemini or opencode
#
# The event JSON arrives on stdin and is passed on as it is. The hook's key
# comes from hook-header, which the app writes next to this script: curl
# reads it from the file, so it never appears on a command line, where any
# process on the Mac could see it with `ps`. Four more things are added as
# headers:
#   - the agent, so the app reads the event in that agent's terms.
#   - the time the event was raised. Hooks run in the background, so two events
#     a few milliseconds apart can arrive in either order.
#   - the agent's tty. Hooks have no terminal of their own, so this walks up
#     the process tree to the first ancestor that has one. The app uses it to
#     find the Terminal tab.
#   - the folder the agent was started in, where the agent says. The event's
#     cwd follows the agent into subfolders; the app names the session's
#     project from this instead.
#
# It never blocks or fails the session. If the app isn't running, the event
# is simply dropped.
#
# Only sessions in Terminal report in. The deck's buttons can only reach
# Terminal's tabs, so a session in any other terminal would be a key that
# lights up but can't be controlled.

# Some agents run hooks with a pared-down environment.
