</p>

A control pad on your phone for the AI coding agents in your terminal: Claude
Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode and Grok.

A key lights up for each of your agent sessions to show what it's doing. You
can approve a permission request from across the room, interrupt an agent, turn
a dial to change how hard Claude thinks, or hold a button and talk to it. Lay
the deck out your way, with buttons of your own, or watch your agents at work
as people in [a little pixel-art office](#the-office). SauzzeDeck Pro runs in
your Mac's menu bar, or in the tray on [Windows and Linux](#windows-and-linux-preview).
Your phone connects to it over your Wi-Fi, so there's nothing to install from
an app store.

SauzzeDeck Pro was called AgentDeck up to version 1.0.1.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/deck-portrait.png" alt="The deck on a phone: six session keys, a dial and a stick" width="300">
</p>

> SauzzeDeck Pro is an independent project. It is not made by or affiliated with Anthropic.

## What's on the deck

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Session keys** | One per agent session, up to nine, sharing the same space: one fills it, four make a 2×2. Each is named after its project: the folder the agent started in, or the top of its git repository. The colour shows its state, and the line underneath its agent, or Claude Code's thinking effort. Tap a key to select that session and bring its Terminal window to the front. |
| **Dial** | Claude Code's thinking effort: low, medium, high, extra high, max. If Claude is mid-task, the change waits until it finishes. |
| **Stick** | When the agent asks you something, slide up or down to choose an answer and tap to confirm. The rest of the time it's a scroll wheel for that session's Terminal window: roll it to scroll, tap to jump back to the bottom. Scrolling is off until you turn on **Let the stick scroll Terminal** on the setup page. Tap the stick's SCROLL / CHOICES label to switch by hand. |
| **✓ and ✕** | Accept or reject a permission request. |
| **🎙 (hold)** | Talk to Claude Code. Release, and Claude sends what you said once it's three words or more. |
| **esc · send · /clear** | Interrupt the agent, press Return, or start a fresh conversation. `/clear` asks you to tap twice, and waits until the agent isn't busy. |
| **☢ Max** and **effort steps** | Optional, from [Layout](#make-it-yours): one press sends Claude straight to max effort, or tap a level from low to max. |

What the key colours mean:

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚪ White | Idle |
| 🔵 Blue, pulsing | Working |
| 🟠 Orange, blinking | Waiting on you: a permission request or a question |
| 🟢 Green | Done, and you haven't looked yet |
| 🔴 Red | Stopped on an error |

Sessions keep their order on the keys; with a fixed number of keys, each
keeps its own key until it ends. You can pin projects to specific keys, lay
the deck out your way and change every colour:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/themes.png" alt="The deck in five colour schemes: Default, Midnight, Moonlight, Light and High contrast" width="100%">
</p>

Four of these are built-in presets. Moonlight is a custom palette, made in the
colour editor in a minute.

## Supported agents

Each agent tells SauzzeDeck Pro what it's doing through its own hooks, and the
deck presses that agent's own keys:

| Agent | Interrupt | Fresh conversation | Dial and mic |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) | Esc | `/clear` | ✓ |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Esc | `/new` | – |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | Esc | `/clear` | – |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | Esc, twice | `/new` | – |
| [Grok](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) | Ctrl+C | `/new` | – |

The dial and the mic drive Claude Code's own `/effort` and `/voice`, so they
switch off when another agent's key is selected. In Grok, ✕ declines with
Ctrl+C, the key Grok uses to cancel a request.

**Codex** asks you to approve new hooks before it runs them: after connecting,
run `/hooks` in Codex once and trust SauzzeDeck Pro's. Codex runs its hooks in
a background service rather than in your tab, so the deck finds each Codex
session's tab by its project folder.

## What you need

- A Mac running macOS 13 or later. On Windows or Linux, see
  [Windows and Linux](#windows-and-linux-preview).
- One or more of the [supported agents](#supported-agents), running in the
  **Terminal** app. Sessions in other terminal apps (iTerm, Ghostty, VS Code…)
  don't appear on the deck, because its buttons can only reach Terminal.
- A phone on the same Wi-Fi as your Mac

## Install

There are two ways. Both give you the same app.

### Download the app

1. Download **SauzzeDeck-Pro.zip** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Sauzze/agentdeck/releases/latest) and open it.
2. Drag **SauzzeDeck Pro** into your Applications folder, then open it.
3. macOS will say it can't check SauzzeDeck Pro for malicious software, because
   the app isn't notarised by Apple. Click **Done**, then go to
   **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click
   **Open Anyway** next to SauzzeDeck Pro. You only do this once.

To check that your download is the one that was published, run
`shasum -a 256 SauzzeDeck-Pro.zip` in Terminal and compare the result with the
SHA-256 in the release notes.

Updating from AgentDeck? Quit it, delete **AgentDeck** from Applications and
install as above. Your settings carry over, but pair your phone again, add it
to your Home Screen again, and turn the app back on under Accessibility (see
[Set up](#set-up)).

### Or build it yourself

You need Apple's free developer tools. The installer offers to install them if
you don't have them. A copy you build yourself opens without the warning.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sauzze/agentdeck.git
cd agentdeck
./install.sh
```

This builds SauzzeDeck Pro, puts it in your Applications folder and opens it.
It also replaces an older copy named AgentDeck.

Either way, you'll see an S in a circle in the menu bar, and the setup page
opens in your browser.

## Set up

The setup page walks you through five steps:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/setup.png" alt="The setup page: its checklist, the keys, and a pairing code with its QR code for your phone" width="720">
</p>

1. **Connect your coding agents.** This lets every supported agent on your Mac
   tell SauzzeDeck Pro what it's doing. Restart any sessions that were already
   open. Install another agent later? Click **Connect** again.
2. **Allow SauzzeDeck Pro to use your keyboard.** System Settings opens. Turn
   on **SauzzeDeck Pro** in the list. The buttons, the mic and scrolling need
   this.
3. **Let the stick scroll Terminal** (optional). Turns the stick into a scroll
   wheel for the selected session's Terminal window.
4. **Let the office hire and fire** (optional). Lets you start and stop agents
   from [the office](#the-office): choose the folder new hires start in, and
   which agent they are.
5. **Open at login** (optional). Keeps the deck ready whenever your Mac is on.

The first time you press a button, macOS asks whether SauzzeDeck Pro may
control Terminal. Click **Allow**.

## Pair your phone

1. On your computer, click the SauzzeDeck Pro icon in the menu bar or tray and
   choose **Pair a Phone…**. The setup page opens with a six-digit code and a
   QR code.
2. Scan the QR code with your phone's camera. Or open your phone's browser, go
   to the address shown with the code (for example `192.168.1.20:7710`) and
   type the code.
3. Add the deck to your Home Screen: on an iPhone, tap **Share → Add to Home
   Screen**; on Android, open the browser's menu and tap **Add to Home
   screen**. SauzzeDeck Pro now opens full screen and stays paired.

While the deck is open, your phone's screen stays on, from your first tap. If
an agent has been waiting on you for five minutes, the deck reminds you once,
with a chime, and a buzz on phones that allow it.

Each phone you pair appears under **Paired phones** on the setup page, with
when it was last used. **Revoke** cuts one phone off straight away;
**Unpair All Phones** does it for every phone, and is also in SauzzeDeck
Pro's menu. A phone you've cut off shows the pairing page again. To use it once
more, pair it with a new code, then remove the old Home Screen icon and add
the deck again: the icon keeps the old pairing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/deck-landscape.png" alt="The deck sideways: keys on the left, controls on the right" width="640">
</p>

## Make it yours

The setup page also has:

- **Keys.** Drag a running session onto a key to keep that project on it.
  Keys you don't pin go to the next session that starts.
- **Logo.** The Sauzze logo or the original six keys, in the menu bar, on the
  setup page and on your phone's Home Screen. A phone picks up a new logo the
  next time you add the deck to its Home Screen.
- **Layout.** Keys or [the office](#the-office), how many keys (Auto, one per
  running session, or always 3, 6 or 9), whether the dial and stick show, and
  up to four rows of buttons, tall or short, each button one to three widths
  wide. Use the deck's own buttons, the ☢ Max button or the effort steps, or
  make your own: a button that types a command, such as `/compact`, or presses
  a key, such as Shift+Tab to switch Claude Code's mode. It can wait until the
  agent isn't busy, ask for a second tap, or be for some agents only. A live
  preview of your phone sits beside the editor.
- **Colours.** Pick any colour for the background, keys, text and each state,
  or start from a preset (Default, Midnight, High contrast, Light). Your
  phone updates as you pick.
- **Profiles.** Save a layout and its colours under a name, and switch between
  them in a click: one for the couch, one for the desk. Default is always the
  standard deck. Export a profile to back it up or share it; it carries your
  office and your team's nicknames too. Before an imported profile is added,
  the setup page lists everything its buttons would type or press.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/layout.png" alt="Profiles and Layout on the setup page: the Couch profile, Auto keys, buttons ✓, ✕ and ☢ Max over esc, send and a /compact button, beside a live preview of the phone" width="720">
</p>

Open the setup page any time from the menu bar (**Open Setup…**), or by opening
SauzzeDeck Pro again from Applications.

## The office

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/office.png" alt="The office: nine agents at their desks, dressed for their models from a T-shirt to a suit, one waving for attention as the room's edge glows, interns round a desk, a dog lying by the web-app desk, an arcade machine in the lounge, and the big red button in the corridor" width="800">
</p>

Your sessions can also be people in a little pixel-art office. Each key is a
desk, in the same order, and the person at it acts out what their session is
doing:

| On the deck | In the office |
|---|---|
| Working | Typing, the screen lit, dots rising from it |
| Waiting on you | Standing up and waving, with a blinking **!**. Kept waiting more than five minutes, they get agitated: hopping, a red **!**, steam from the ears |
| Done, unread | Leaning back with a coffee and a ✓ |
| Idle | Off to the coffee machine, the window, the water cooler, the couch or a game of ping-pong |
| Error | Head in hands, smoke from the screen. A rate limit has them waiting under the clock instead. |
| A new session, an ended one | Someone walks in through the door, or out of it |

There's more to see while they work:

- **Under each desk**, the project's name and what its agent is doing, such as
  *Editing Settings.swift* or *Waiting for you: Bash*.
- **On the monitor**, how long the turn has run. After ten minutes, the agent
  starts to sweat.
- **What they're working with.** Reading files, they leaf through papers; a
  command turns the screen terminal-green; the web spins a globe on the desk;
  a to-do list sends them to the whiteboard. Compacting the conversation, they
  feed it into a shredder.
- **Interns**, one for each of Claude Code's subagents, gather round the desk
  while they work: up to four, then a "+n".
- **What they wear** is the size of their model, the bigger the smarter: small
  models such as Haiku, GPT mini or Gemini Flash-Lite dress casual, in a
  T-shirt and jeans; medium ones such as Sonnet wear a shirt; large ones such
  as Opus or Gemini Pro a jacket; and the top ones, such as Fable, a suit and
  tie. Interns dress for their own model. While an agent's model isn't known,
  as for most agents but Claude Code, it wears its agent's colour.
- **The desk's colour** is Claude Code's effort, from white for low to red for
  max. Press ☢ Max, and the agent runs to the big red button in the corridor
  and slams it.
- When few sessions are running, the office's own staff hang around the lounge.

**Furnish it your way** under *Office* in the setup page's Layout:

- **A style** furnishes the whole office in one go: Classic, Campsite, Royal
  court, Space station, Pirate cove, Arctic base, Dragon's lair, Gamer den,
  Startup garage, Fitness floor or Jungle. Switch it from your phone too: in
  full screen, tap the key in the room's top-left corner and pick one. **Yours**
  is the office as you furnish it below, and changing anything there takes you
  back to it. Your team, the daylight, the seasons and the sound stay as you
  set them.
- **Talk into** a microphone or a megaphone.
- **The back wall:** five places, each a window, a whiteboard, a pinboard, a
  poster, a bookshelf, a plant or bare wall. The to-do lists go up on the
  first whiteboard.
- **The floor** in wood, tiles, concrete or carpet, **the walls** in slate,
  sage, clay or cream, and **the lounge's carpet** in navy, teal, plum or sand.
- **In the lounge:** one of 23 pieces, each picked from its picture: an arcade
  machine, a vending machine, a foosball table, a fish tank, a bookcase and a
  beanbag, a dragon asleep on its gold, pinball, a jukebox, a pool table, a
  piano, a drum kit, a telescope, jellyfish, a bonsai, a jungle, a coffee bar,
  servers, a 3D printer, a punching bag, a treadmill, a hot tub, a ball pit or a
  campfire. Idle agents and staff go and play, grab a snack, or sit by the fire,
  and the pet joins in.
- **Where everyone works:** at a desk, or a standing desk, a gaming desk, a
  tent, a cardboard box, a beanbag, an igloo, a camper van, a spaceship, a
  pirate ship, a throne or a greenhouse. Each project can have its own on its
  team card, and it goes with them when they swap desks.
- **Daylight** that follows the clock, with night falling at 8 pm, or always day.
- **Seasons in the windows:** snow in winter, with lights strung along the wall
  through December, falling leaves in autumn, blossom in spring, birds in summer.
- **A pet:** a cat that naps on the couch, a dog that follows people about, a
  lizard that basks on the wall, or a monkey that climbs on things and steals
  cups.
- **Sound:** off, quiet or normal, in the style of an old games console, and
  mostly silence: a burst of typing as an agent gets to work, the door, the
  coffee machine, a ping-pong rally, the red button's siren, a hire, a firing,
  the pets, the wind in winter, and now and then the lounge's piece while
  someone's at it. The one sound that asks for you is the reminder after five
  minutes of waiting. It starts with your first tap, as browsers require.
- **The desks** in wood, walnut, white or black, where no effort paints them,
  and **the chairs** in teal, black, red, grey or green.
- **Office staff:** a few, none, or lots of them in the lounge.

**Arrange the room** puts everything where you want it. Click **Arrange the
room…** under *Office*, and the office fills the window: click a piece to pick
it and drag it anywhere. The desks move; the lounge's piece, the couch, the
ping-pong table, the plant, the coffee counter, the red button and the mic
also come in small, medium or large, and all but the button and the mic can
be put away and brought back. **Clear the room** starts from an empty lounge,
and **Back to standard** puts everything back. The room on its side and
upright are arranged on their own, and your phone follows as you go.

**Your team**, under the furnishing, has a card for each of your projects:
choose its agent's skin, hair and hairstyle, something extra (glasses,
sunglasses, headphones, a cap, a beanie, a beard, a moustache or a bow), an
outfit and its colour, what's on their desk, where they work, and a nickname
for their desk's label. Anything left on Auto stays as the office picks it, and clothes on Auto
follow the model.

**The dress code**, under the team, chooses the outfit and colour for each size
of model, and for each agent while its model isn't known. Add your own rules
for models the office doesn't know, such as "a model whose name contains
`qwen-max` is large". Thirteen outfits to choose from, there and on the team
cards, from a T-shirt to a lab coat, overalls or a Hawaiian shirt.

It's all kept with the layout, so each profile can have an office of its own.

**On your phone**, choose **Office** under *Sessions* in the setup page's
Layout, or tap **OFFICE** above the keys to switch on the phone itself (and
**KEYS** to switch back). The dial, stick and buttons stay where they are, and
the room works like the keys:

| Tap | What it does |
|---|---|
| A desk, or its person | Selects that session and brings its Terminal window to the front, like its key |
| An agent's desk, held, then dragged | Picks the agent up, chair and all. Let go over another desk and the two swap. They stay that way: each project is pinned to its new key, as on the setup page's *Keys*, where you can undo it. |
| The red button | ☢ Max for the selected session |
| The microphone, held | Talks to the selected session, like 🎙 |
| A desk, or its person, held* | On a Claude Code desk, puts paint chips along its front, from white for low to red for max: tap one to set its effort, like the dial, and they go away. Max is the red button's. With hiring and firing on, also **YOU'RE FIRED**, or **HIRE** on a desk a new hire would take (see below). |
| ▲ ▼ ✓ ✕, over an agent waiting on you* | Move through its options, accept or reject, like the stick and ✓ ✕. Select the agent, and the keys appear over its desk. |

\* Where the deck's own controls are out of sight: in full screen, on `/office`
and in the pop-out window. Beside the dial and the stick, use those.

**Hire and fire**, once you turn on **Let the office hire and fire** on the
setup page (it's off until you do):

- **Hold an agent's desk**, and a red **YOU'RE FIRED** comes out above its
  chips. Tap it, confirm, and its work stops and its Terminal tab closes. The
  agent packs a box and walks out. Claude Code keeps the conversation, so
  `claude --resume` can bring it back.
- **Hold the desk a new hire would take**, the next free one, and **HIRE**
  comes out. Tap it, and a new Terminal window opens in the folder you chose
  on the setup page, with the agent you chose at work in it. The new hire walks
  in through the door. On a pinned project's empty desk, HIRE starts the agent
  in that project instead.

On Windows and Linux, firing closes the agent's pane in tmux, kitty and
WezTerm, and stops an agent started with `sauzzedeck run`. Hiring needs the
Mac app, for now.

**Full screen:** tap **⛶** above the room, and the dial and buttons step aside
for it. The desks, the red button and the microphone work as above, and the
corner brings the controls back. Held upright, the room stands upright too: the
lounge moves below the desks, through a doorway at the end of the corridor.

**On a spare screen**, such as an old tablet, a TV or a second monitor, open the
address your phone uses with `/office` at the end. It pairs like a phone, then
shows the office alone, full screen, and can be tapped too.

**On top of your other windows:** on the computer running SauzzeDeck Pro, open
`http://localhost:7710/office` in Chrome or Edge and click **POP OUT** in its
corner. The office moves into a small window that stays above everything else,
and can still be clicked. Other browsers, and the address your phone uses,
don't offer it.

**As your Mac's screen saver:** click the SauzzeDeck Pro icon in the menu bar
and choose **Install Screen Saver…**. System Settings opens at Screen Saver:
choose **SauzzeDeck Office**, click **Options…**, and enter a code from
**Pair a Phone…**. It's listed under Paired phones as **Screen saver**. While
your Mac is idle, each display shows the office, just to watch: a key or a click
ends the screen saver as usual. When SauzzeDeck Pro isn't running, or the screen
saver was unpaired, it says what to do instead. After updating SauzzeDeck Pro,
choose **Install Screen Saver…** again.

In full screen, on a spare screen and in the pop-out window, the office fills a
rounded window; the screen saver fills each display edge to edge. Either way,
its edge glows while an agent is waiting on you.

## Voice

The mic button uses Claude Code's own voice input (`/voice`), in *tap* mode.
Connecting Claude Code sets that up, unless you had already set voice up
yourself. In that case, make sure `~/.claude/settings.json` contains:

```json
"voice": { "enabled": true, "mode": "tap" }
```

Voice input needs Claude Code signed in with a Claude.ai account. Claude Code
sends your audio to Anthropic to be transcribed. SauzzeDeck Pro itself never
hears it.

## Privacy and security

- **SauzzeDeck Pro sends nothing off your network.** It talks only to your
  phone and to the coding agents on your computer. It has no accounts, no analytics and
  no cloud service.
- **Each phone has its own key.** Every request carries a long random key that
  only that phone has. The key is never typed: pairing hands it over. Your
  computer keeps only a fingerprint of each key (a SHA-256 hash), so you can revoke one
  phone without touching the others.
- **Buttons you make type only what you set up.** A phone names a button by
  its id; the command it types, or the key it presses, comes from your
  computer. A paired phone can't send text of its own.
- **Pairing codes are short-lived.** A code exists only after you ask for one.
  It works once and expires after five minutes. Five wrong tries from one
  device lock that device out until you get a new code, and twenty wrong tries
  in all withdraw the code. The QR code holds the same one-time code, never a
  key, and disappears once the code is used.
- **The agents have a key of their own.** Their hook uses a separate
  key, read from a file only you can read, so it never shows up in the list of
  running processes. It works only from your computer, and only for reporting what
  an agent is doing. A phone's key can't pose as an agent, and the agents' key
  can't drive the deck.
- **Scrolling, hiring and firing are off until you turn them on.** Out of the
  box, a paired phone can only use the deck's buttons, dial and choices, and
  move desks around in the office, which pins projects to keys as the setup
  page does. Even turned on, firing asks first, and only stops the agent
  itself; hiring only starts the agent you chose, in the folder you chose or
  in a pinned project's.
- **The screen saver pairs like a phone,** and keeps its key in its own
  settings, as a phone's browser does.
- **The office says what your agents are doing in a few words.** They're made
  from a file's name, a web page's site or the description the agent gave a
  step, never from a command or a file's path.
- **SauzzeDeck Pro listens on port 7710 on your network,** so your phone can
  reach it. Without a key, all another device gets is the pairing page. Its
  pages can't be shown inside other websites, and it turns away connections
  beyond a fixed limit, so a misbehaving device can't swamp it.
- **The setup page only opens on your computer.** Other devices can't reach it, and
  other websites can't press its buttons.
- **Use a network you trust.** The connection is plain HTTP on your local
  network. Use SauzzeDeck Pro on home or office Wi-Fi, not public hotspots.

## Troubleshooting

**The keys stay empty.** Click **Connect** on the setup page, then restart your
agent sessions. On a Mac, they need to run in the Terminal app. On Windows and
Linux, start them with `sauzzedeck run`, or in tmux, WezTerm or kitty.

**Codex sessions don't appear.** Run `/hooks` in Codex and trust SauzzeDeck
Pro's hook. Codex skips new hooks until you do.

**Buttons, the mic or scrolling do nothing, or the phone says keyboard access
is off.** Turn SauzzeDeck Pro on in System
Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility. Updating SauzzeDeck Pro clears
that permission, because macOS treats each version as a new app. Click
**Open Settings** on the setup page again afterwards, and turn SauzzeDeck Pro
back on.

**The stick says SCROLL OFF.** Turn on **Let the stick scroll Terminal** on the
setup page.

**The phone shows the pairing page instead of the deck.** It was revoked, or
it was paired with AgentDeck 1.0. Pair it again, then add it to your Home
Screen again: see [Pair your phone](#pair-your-phone).

**The mic types a space instead of listening.** Claude's input box has to be
empty, and voice has to be in tap mode: see [Voice](#voice).

**The phone can't connect.** Check that both devices are on the same Wi-Fi.
If macOS or Windows Firewall asked whether SauzzeDeck Pro may accept incoming
connections, allow it.

**HIRE doesn't come out.** Turn on **Let the office hire and fire** on the
setup page, and choose a folder for new hires. HIRE shows only on a desk a new
hire would take: the next free one, or a pinned project's. Hiring needs the
Mac app, for now.

**The screen saver says to open SauzzeDeck Pro, or to pair again.** Make sure
SauzzeDeck Pro is running. If it was unpaired, open System Settings → Screen
Saver, click **Options…** and enter a new code. After updating SauzzeDeck Pro,
choose **Install Screen Saver…** again.

**"Port 7710 is in use."** Another copy of SauzzeDeck Pro, or another app, is
using that port. Quit it and open SauzzeDeck Pro again.

## Uninstall

1. On the setup page, click **Disconnect** next to your coding agents, and turn
   off **Open at login**.
2. Quit SauzzeDeck Pro from the menu bar.
3. Delete **SauzzeDeck Pro** from Applications, and the folder
   `~/Library/Application Support/AgentDeck`. It kept the app's original name.
4. If you installed the screen saver, choose another one in System Settings →
   Screen Saver, then delete **SauzzeDeck Office.saver** from
   `~/Library/Screen Savers`, and the files starting with
   `io.github.sauzze.agentdeck.screensaver` in
   `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Engine.legacyScreenSaver/Data/Library/Preferences/ByHost`.

On Windows and Linux, disconnect and turn off **Open at login** the same way,
quit SauzzeDeck Pro from its tray menu, then delete:

- **Linux:** `~/.local/bin/sauzzedeck`,
  `~/.local/share/applications/sauzzedeck-pro.desktop`, and the folders
  `~/.local/share/sauzzedeck-pro` and `~/.config/sauzzedeck-pro`.
- **Windows:** the folder you extracted, and `%APPDATA%\SauzzeDeck Pro`.

Connecting left a backup of each settings file it changed next to it, ending
in `.agentdeck.bak`: Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json`, Codex's
`~/.codex/hooks.json` and Gemini CLI's `~/.gemini/settings.json`. Delete them
once you no longer need them. Connecting Claude Code also turned on its voice
input, if it was off. Disconnecting leaves voice as it is: remove the `voice`
entry from `~/.claude/settings.json` if you don't want it.

## How it works

Each agent runs a small script ([`Resources/report.sh`](Resources/report.sh))
at each step of a session, through its hooks: Claude Code's
[hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), and the matching settings in
Codex, Gemini CLI and Grok. OpenCode has no command hooks, so a small plugin
([`Resources/opencode-plugin.js`](Resources/opencode-plugin.js)) runs the same
script. The script tells SauzzeDeck Pro what happened and which Terminal tab it
happened in. SauzzeDeck Pro reads each agent's events in that agent's terms,
works out each session's state and streams it to your phone. On Windows and
Linux, `sauzzedeck hook` does the script's job, and names the launcher, tmux
pane or terminal window instead of a Terminal tab.

On the Mac, controls work in one of two ways:

- **Typed commands** such as `/effort` and `/clear` are typed into the tab
  through Terminal's scripting.
- **Keys and scrolling** are sent as ordinary keystrokes. Scrolling uses
  Terminal's own View → Line Up and Line Down, so it moves the window's view
  and the agent receives nothing.
- **Hiring** opens a new Terminal window through Terminal's scripting, in the
  folder you chose, with the agent's own command. **Firing** stops the agent's
  process in its tab, only once it's sure that's the agent, then closes the
  tab.

The Mac app is plain Swift with no dependencies. The Windows and Linux app is
Go, with a handful: a tray icon, pseudo-terminals, QR codes. The phone side is
a single web page, shared by both.

## Windows and Linux (preview)

SauzzeDeck Pro also runs on Windows and Linux, with the same phone deck, the
same pairing and the same agents. It's a preview: the Linux version is
tested, the Windows version is built but hasn't been run on a real PC yet.
Please report how it goes in [the issues](https://github.com/Sauzze/agentdeck/issues).

What's different from the Mac:

- **Start agents through SauzzeDeck Pro**, in any terminal:
  `sauzzedeck run claude`, or `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode` or `grok`. The
  agent runs exactly as usual, and the deck can press its keys, with no
  permission to grant. Windows and Linux have no equivalent of Terminal's
  scripting, so this is how the deck reaches a session.
- **In tmux, WezTerm or kitty**, agents started the usual way work too: the
  deck sends keys through the terminal's own commands. kitty needs its remote
  control turned on (`allow_remote_control yes` and `listen_on` in
  `kitty.conf`).
- **Tapping a key** brings its pane forward in tmux, WezTerm and kitty. In the
  launcher it only selects the session, because the launcher can't tell which
  window it's in.
- **The scroll wheel** works in tmux and kitty.
- **No Accessibility step.** Nothing here needs that permission.

### Linux

Download **SauzzeDeck-Pro-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz** (or `-arm64`) from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Sauzze/agentdeck/releases/latest), then:

```bash
tar -xzf SauzzeDeck-Pro-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./SauzzeDeck-Pro-Linux-x86_64/install.sh
```

This installs it for you alone, in `~/.local`, with an entry in your app
menu. Open **SauzzeDeck Pro** from the menu, or run `sauzzedeck`. The setup
page opens in your browser.

- On GNOME, the tray icon needs the AppIndicator extension, which Ubuntu
  includes. Without it, SauzzeDeck Pro still runs: open
  `http://localhost:7710/setup` yourself.
- On a machine without a desktop, such as one you reach over SSH, run
  `sauzzedeck serve`.

### Windows

1. Download **SauzzeDeck-Pro-Windows-x86_64.zip** (or `-arm64` for an ARM
   PC) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Sauzze/agentdeck/releases/latest),
   and extract it.
2. Open **SauzzeDeck Pro.exe**. Windows SmartScreen warns about an unsigned
   app: click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
3. When Windows Firewall asks, allow SauzzeDeck Pro on private networks, so
   your phone can reach it.

To type `sauzzedeck run claude` in a terminal, add the extracted folder to
your PATH. The setup page also shows the full command for where it is.

### Build it yourself

You need [Go](https://go.dev) 1.26 or later:

```bash
go build ./cmd/sauzzedeck
```

`go test ./...` runs the tests, and `scripts/release-desktop.sh` builds the
downloads for both systems.
