// The phone sees the same deck, pairs the same way and follows the same
// agents. What differs is how a session's keys are pressed: the Mac drives
// Terminal.app, which nothing on Windows or Linux matches, so here agents are
// started through the app's launcher (`smolcorp run claude`), or found in a
// tmux, WezTerm or kitty pane, whose own commands reach them.
